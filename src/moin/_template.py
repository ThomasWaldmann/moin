MoinMoin - source code header template.

Please use this template when starting a new Python source file.

It is important that all source code files have the same header structure,
are correctly copyrighted and licensed, and have a reasonable docstring
explaining what the module or package does.

Of course, you'll have to edit/fix the Copyright line, and the docstring
needs to be replaced with something meaningful, but keep the structure.
